# Birthday Report

This is a simple CiviCRM report giving you a list of the upcoming birthdays of
your contacts. Simply install the extension, create a new report, and use
"Available for Dashboard" to give you the list upon login.

**NEW Feature:** This extension now provices an API for sending birthday greetings automatically via e-mail.

The extension is currently localised for English and German, but it since the
infrastructure is there, adding another language should be pretty easy. We're
also planning add more features (see
[here](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.birthdays/issues)), but currently
lack the funding.
